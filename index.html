		</div>
			<p>My name is Rosana Sincere and I'm from Miami, Florida. 
			I'm 18 and I'm currently attending Illinois Intitute of Technology.
			<p>My major is Information Technology and Management.
			I have a history with software design and cyber security, and I'm intersted in learning about both of them as much as I can. </p>
			<p>I was first introduced to programming when I was a sophmore in highschool through a digital design class. I was studying
			to get my certifications in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Dreamweaver. My teacher at the time gave us material to learn a little bit
			of basic html, in case we needed to review the HTML in the prewritten code in Dreamweaver. I was very interested in it and wanted
			to learn more about it.</p>
			<p>I did some research about free oppertunities for students to learn about programming over the summer and 
			I found out about the <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a> program that launched in Miami the year before. I applied and got accepted and spent the 
			summer of 2015 learning intro courses in programming languages like HTML, JavaScript, JQuary, and Python. We also were introduced to 
			things like networking and business attire and resumes. From there on, I was hooked.</p>
			<p>I also was curious about electrical engineering, so I applied for a duel-enrollment program at a school called 
			<a href="http://bakeraviationtechcollege.com/">George T Baker Aviation Technical College</a>, where I studied Avionics for 
			2 years. I really enjoyed Avionics so, curious me, I did some research and emailed around until I got in contact with someone at <a href="https://www.fiu.edu/">Florida 
			International University(FIU)</a> who was in charge of a 6-week youth internship program with the FIU School of Engineering called the Young Scholars ASSIST 
			program.</p>
			<p>I was very lucky to have been able to learn so much and do so much concidering my age and financial status, and these experiences 
			have all really helped me to narrow down what I do and do not want to pursue a career in. I chose ITM since it's where I feel I can really 
			excel in, since it deals with things that I am very passionate about and I can keep learning new things in. I'm also passionate about art. 
				You can usually find me at my happiest with earphones in. I'm really looking forward to learning all that I can about Information Technology 
				in the upcoming years.
