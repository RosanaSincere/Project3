			<p>
			My name is Rosana Sincere and I'm from Miami, Florida. 
			I'm 18 and I'm currently attending Illinois Intitute of Technology. </p>
			
			<p>My major is Information Technology and Management.
			I have a history with software design and cyber security, and I'm intersted in learning about both of them as much as I can. </p>
			
			<p>I'm also passionate about music (I play both the guitar and the ukulele) and I love art, especially poetry.
			I'm looking forward to learning all that I can about Information Technology in the upcoming years.
